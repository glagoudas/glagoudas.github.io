## Policy

*Key policy interests: Nexus of climate change, nutrition, and biotechnology. Other interests: biosecurity, genetic engineering, pandemic preparedness, public health, agriculture, environment, STEM education, emerging technologies.*

- **AAAS Congressional Science & Engineering Policy Fellow** -- 2019--2020
- **Alumni Relations Officer**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Science Policy Initiative -- 2014--2017
    - Created the Alumni Relations Officer position & created database of >100 alumni
    - Coordinated annual visits to MIT Washington Office, federal science agencies, and Congressional offices
    - Organized speaker panel at 2017 AAAS Annual Meeting, including the first annual student networking reception

## Bioengineering & life sciences

*Expertise: Bioengineering, microbiology, data analysis, DNA sequencing, computer programming*

- **Scientist** -- DSM Nutrition Innovation Center -- Lexington, MA -- 2018--2019
    - Developed agricultural animal feed products that improve microbiome health and reduce antibiotic usage
- **Graduate student & postdoctoral associate** -- Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard -- Cambridge, MA -- 2013--2018
