I'm a scientist, communicator, and motivated citizen. I care about solving
problems that matter and using data and logic to drive our decisions. I am
currently a Senior Fellow at the Brown University Pandemic Center and a member of the faculty at the Brown School of Public Health.

I was previously a [AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering Policy
Fellow](https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships)
working in Washington, D.C. as part of [Senator Ed Markey's](https://www.markey.senate.gov/)
team on [energy and the environment](https://www.markey.senate.gov/priorities/energy-climate-change-and-environment).

I recently worked at DSM, a multinational company that creates products in
nutrition, health, and materials. I applied my skills of project management,
microbial sequencing, and microbiome analysis to help create products that can
improve animal gut health. Our goal was to reduce the use of antibiotics for
growth promotion in animals.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2018 in [Paul Blainey's lab](http://blainey.mit.edu/)
at MIT and the Broad Institute. I built microfluidic technologies to analyze
microbial genomes, and I used DNA sequencing to study antibiotic resistance. I
have experience in genomic sequencing, microfluidics, microbiology, and
bioinformatics.

I have 5+ years of coaching and mentoring students, and I served as a
[Communication Fellow](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
