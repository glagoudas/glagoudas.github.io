Testing

Your Brain Runs on (Clean) Air
--

I gave a talk titled "Your Brain Runs on (Clean) Air" on Nov 19, nestled between talks about open-source microfabrication, medical imaging tools, and the future of computing. It might seem unusual to bring indoor air quality to a crypto conference, but the connection is real: the air we breathe indoors directly shapes how well our brains function. We spend 90% of our time indoors, and studies show that air pollutants, high CO₂, and airborne viruses can meaningfully impair decision-making, reaction time, learning, and memory.

For a community obsessed with performance -- whether it’s improving coordination, writing better code, or making smarter governance decisions -- this matters. High CO₂ can [reduce cognitive performance by up to 50%](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037). And studies with airplane pilots found that as CO₂ ticks up to 2500 ppm (not uncommon in classrooms), the odds of making mistakes on plane maneuvers went up by 50%. Yikes! Particulate matter lowers test scores: adding air purifiers inside classrooms during a natural experiment in California showed that scores [improved by about 8%](https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/Gilraine_AirFilters_1.pdf). And test scores during big national exams were [lower on days](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/app.20150213) with higher outdoor particulate matter. Bioaerosols like the virus particles that cause Covid can have lasting cognitive effects. A large cohort study found that [IQ dropped](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330) by 3-6 points after one symptomatic infection. If we care about clearer thinking and better outcomes, clean indoor air is one of the highest-leverage tools we have.

There’s also a natural connection to the Ethereum and d/acc ethos. Clean air systems include low-cost sensors, open-source filtration designs, and transparent real-time data -- all of which can be decentralized, permissionless, and community-driven. They make the invisible visible, turning every room into something you can measure, verify, and improve without gatekeepers.
